			<h2>Welcome to the non-official DOTA 2 Website</h2>
			<p>Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena video game, the stand-alone sequel to the Defense of the Ancients (DotA) Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne mod. 
			Developed by Valve Corporation, Dota 2 was released as a free-to-play title for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux in July 2013, concluding a Windows-only public beta testing phase that began in 2011. 
			The game is available exclusively through Valve's content-delivery platform, Steam. Dota 2 is played in matches involving two teams of five players, each of which occupies a stronghold at a corner of the map. Each stronghold contains a building called the "Ancient", which the opposite team must destroy to win the match. Each player controls a "Hero" character and focuses on leveling up, collecting gold, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory.
			Development of Dota 2 began in 2009, when the developer of the DotA mod, IceFrog, was hired by Valve as lead designer. Dota 2 was praised by critics for its gameplay, production quality and faithfulness to its predecessor. However, the game was criticized for its steep learning curve and inhospitable community. Dota 2 has become the most actively played game on Steam, with daily peaks of over 800,000 concurrent players.</p>

			<h2>Pre-release</h2>
			<p class="back"><a href="#">Back to the top</a></p>
			<p>PC Gamer reviewed Dota 2 in September 2012 stating the game was "an unbelievably deep and complex game that offers the purest sequel to the original DotA. Rewarding like few others, but tough", giving it a rating of 85/100. In May 2013, Dota 2 reached almost 330,000 concurrent players and holds the record for the game with the most concurrent users in Steam history, breaking its own record set in March the same year. Simultaneous with this benchmark, it was determined that the concurrent number of Dota 2 players in May 2013 outweighed the number of players for the rest of Steam's top ten most-played games combined.</p>
			<h2>Awards and Accolades</h2>
			<p>Following its first public showing, Dota 2 won IGN's People's Choice Award. In December 2012, PC Gamer listed Dota 2 as a nominee for the 2012 Game of the Year award, as well as the best electronic sports title of the year. The game won 2013 esport of the year awards from PC Gamer and onGamers. GameTrailers awarded the game the award for Best PC Game of 2013. For IGN's Best of 2013 award series, Dota 2 won the awards for Best PC Strategy and Tactics Game, as well as Best PC Multiplayer Game. The game's awards for IGN's Best of 2013 won their People's Choice Award counterparts, as well. Similarly, Game Informer recognized Dota 2 for the categories of Best PC Exclusive, Best Competitive Multiplayer and Best Strategy of 2013. In the 2013 edition of Game Revolution's countdown of the top twenty-five PC video games of all time, Dota 2 was listed in the number four position. Dota 2 was nominated for a number of Game of the Year awards by Destructoid, including the award for the best competitive game. While the staff selected StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm, Dota 2 received the majority of the votes distributed between the nine nominees. Dota 2 was nominated for best multiplayer game for the 2014 British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Video Game Awards, but lost to Grand Theft Auto V.</p>

			<p>Dota 2 was very well received by critics. On aggregate review website Metacritic, the game maintains a weighted score of 90 out of 100, based on 31 reviews. On GameRankings, the game has a score of 89%, based on reviews from fifteen critics. Adam Biessener, the editor who authored the reveal piece for Dota 2 for Game Informer magazine in 2010, praised Valve for maintaining the same mechanics and game balance that made Defense of the Ancients successful nearly a decade prior and Quintin Smith of Eurogamer described Dota 2 as the "supreme form of the MOBA which everyone else working in the genre is trying to capture like lightning in a bottle". In September 2013, Dota 2 had 500,000 concurrent players. As of June 2014, Dota 2 has become the most actively played game on Steam, with daily peaks of over 800,000 concurrent players. In February 2015, Dota 2 became the first game on Steam to have over one million concurrent players.
			The most frequently praised aspects of the game were its depth, delivery and overall balance. In Chris Thursten of PC Gamer's review, he described the gameplay as being "deep and rewarding". Martin Gaston of GameSpot complimented Valve for the delivery and artistic design of Dota 2, citing the execution of the user interface design, voice acting and characterization as exceeding those of the game's competitors. Phill Cameron of IGN praised Dota 2 for its freely-available game balance that is not affected by cosmetic items.
			While the majority of reviewers gave Dota 2 highly positive reviews, a common criticism was that the game maintains a steep learning curve that requires exceptional commitment to overcome. While providing a moderately positive review that praised Valve's product stability, Fredrik Åslund from the Swedish division of Gamereactor described his first match of Dota 2 as one of the most humiliating and inhospitable experiences of his gaming career, citing the learning curve and players' attitudes as unwelcoming. Benjamin Danneberg of GameStar alluded to the learning curve as a "learning cliff", calling the newcomer's experience to be painful, with the tutorial feature new to the Dota franchise only being partially successful. In a review for the Metro newspaper, Dota 2 was criticized for not compensating for the flaws with the learning curve from DotA, as well as the predominantly negative online community, as is often the case for multiplayer online battle arena games.</p>

			<h2>Gameplay</h2>
			<p class="back"><a href="#">Back to the top</a></p>
			<p>Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game in a three-dimensional environment, presented from an oblique high-angle perspective. The player commands one of 110 controllable character "Heroes." Each Hero begins the match at level one and becomes more powerful by accumulating experience points through combat, thereby leveling up to the maximum level of twenty-five. With every level gained the player either selects a new ability for their Hero to learn or enhance their general statistics. Each Hero's method of combat is influenced by its primary property: Strength, Agility, or Intelligence.</p>
			<p>Each match of Dota 2 takes place on a functionally symmetrical 
			map that features the strongholds of two warring factions, the 
			Radiant and the Dire. The Radiant is based at the southwest corner 
			of the map, while the Dire is based at the northeast corner; the two 
			sides are divided by a river that runs perpendicular to the central 
			lane. These factions are defended by up to five players. In each 
			stronghold is a critical structure called the "Ancient", a fountain 
			that provide health and lesser structures. These bases are connected 
			by three paths, referred to as "lanes"—two run alongside the edges 
			of the map, while one runs directly between the two bases. The lanes 
			are guarded by defensive Towers, as well as autonomous characters 
			called "creeps", which periodically spawn in groups and travel along 
			the lanes, attacking enemies they encounter. Featured across the map are hostile characters referred to as "neutrals", which are not aligned to either faction and are primarily located in the forests (primarily referred to as "the jungle" in the game, hence the term "jungler" for one who attacks neutral creeps in the jungle). Located in a tarn on the Dire side of the east part of the river is a neutral creep "boss" called "Roshan", who typically requires multiple team members to kill and drops powerful the powerful item "Aegis of Immortality", and significant amounts of gold and experience.</p>
			<p>Dota 2 features items, which the player stores in an inventory. These items are acquired predominantly through purchase with gold, the in-game currency. Items vary in function: some enhance the statistics of a Hero, while others grant additional abilities. The player automatically receives small increments of gold continuously, though they can obtain more by destroying enemies. Killing non-player characters grants gold only to the player who lands the final blow, whereas killing enemy Heroes grants gold to the player's nearby allies as well. Destroying Towers or killing Roshan gives gold to all players on the team. "Denying" is a feature of the game where players inhibit the enemy's ability to accumulate gold and experience by killing an allied unit or destroying an allied structure before the enemy can do so.</p>
			<p>Dota 2 features seasonal events, which provide players with the option of playing the game with special game modes that alter the aesthetics and objectives. With the seasonal event game modes, the central focus of the game shifts away from the standard battle composition, in order to focus on new objectives central to the seasonal events. So far, there have been three seasonal events: the Halloween-themed Diretide event, the Christmas-themed Frostivus event, and the New Bloom Festival, which celebrates the coming of spring.</p>

			<h2>Origins</h2>
			<p class="back"><a href="#">Back to the top</a></p>
			<p>The earliest version of Dota emerged in 2003, with the release of 
			the custom Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos mod called Defense of the 
			Ancients (DotA), which was created and updated by the pseudonymous 
			designer "Eul". After Blizzard Entertainment released the expansion 
			pack The Frozen Throne in 2003, clones of the DotA mod competed for 
			popularity, with DotA: Allstars by Steve "Guinsoo" Feak being the 
			most popular. With the assistance of his friend, Steve "Pendragon" 
			Mescon, Feak created the official DotA community website 
			dota-allstars.com and formed a holding company for it called 
			DotA-Allstars, LLC. When Feak retired from developing DotA in 2005, 
			a friend, under the pseudonym "IceFrog", took his place. The popularity of DotA increased significantly; it became one of the most popular mods in the world, and, by 2008, a prominent electronic sports title. In May 2009, IceFrog and Mescon had a falling out, prompting the latter to create a new official community at playdota.com.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="concept">
			<h2>Concept</h2>
			<p class="back"><a href="#">Back to the top</a></p>
			<p>According to Valve Corporation managing director Gabe Newell, the 
			company's investment in Defense of the Ancients began when several 
			veteran employees—including Team Fortress designer Robin Walker, 
			programmer Adrian Finol and project manager Erik Johnson—became 
			interested in the mod and attempted to play it competitively. They 
			began to correspond with IceFrog about his long-term plans for the 
			mod. The email conversations culminated in Erik Johnson offering 
			IceFrog a tour of the company, after which he was hired to develop a 
			sequel. The first public notification regarding the development of 
			the game was a post on IceFrog's blog on October 5, 2009, in which 
			he disclosed that he would be leading a team at Valve. No further 
			word was given until Dota 2 was officially announced on October 13, 
			2010, when the website of Game Informer revealed a general synopsis 
			of the game and its development. The resultant surge of traffic 
			crashed Game Informer‍'​s servers.</p>
			<p>With Valve's acquisition of the franchise, the company adopted 
			the term "Dota", which derives from the original mod's acronym for 
			"Defense of the Ancients". Erik Johnson explained that this was for 
			the reason that the term "Dota" refers to a concept, rather than an 
			acronym. Shortly after a questions and answers session by IceFrog 
			about the new game, Valve filed a trademark claim. At Gamescom 2011, 
			Gabe Newell said that the trademark was a necessary measure for 
			developing a sequel with the already identifiable brand name. Steve Feak and Steve Mescon expressed their concern that Valve did not have the right to trademark the Dota name, which they believed was a community asset. They filed an opposing trademark for "DOTA" on behalf of DotA-Allstars, LLC, then a subsidiary of their employer, Riot Games, on August 9, 2010. 
			Rob Pardo, the executive vice president of Blizzard Entertainment, 
			expressed a similar concern, explaining his perspective that the 
			DotA name was an asset of their game's community. Blizzard acquired 
			DotA-Allstars, LLC from Riot Games and filed an opposition against 
			Valve in November 2011, citing Blizzard's ownership of both the 
			Warcraft III World Editor and DotA-Allstars, LLC as proper claims to 
			the franchise. On May 11, 2012, Blizzard and Valve announced that 
			the dispute had been settled, with Valve retaining the commercial 
			franchising rights to the term "Dota", while non-commercial usage of 
			the name could still be utilized.</p>

			<h2>Design</h2>
			<p class="back"><a href="#">Back to the top</a></p>
			<p>Early on in development, the goal for Dota 2 was to translate the 
			aesthetic aspects of DotA to the Source engine, while presenting 
			expanded support for the game's framework. Dota 2 features the 
			factions of the Radiant and the Dire in the stead of the Sentinel 
			and the Scourge respectively, with the characters' respective 
			alignment preserved, while also re-establishing their individual 
			character traits in a stand-alone form. Character names, abilities, 
			items, map design and other fine details remain predominantly 
			unchanged, but the Source engine allows for continued, scaled 
			development to bypass engine limitations of the Warcraft III World 
			Editor. The Dota profile matchmaking feature scales a player's 
			automated placement with their estimated skill level, which supports 
			the competitive experience. Unranked practice matches can also be 
			played with other human players, AI bots, or alone. In the debut 
			questions and answers post at the Dota 2 blog, IceFrog stated that 
			the game would serve as the long-term continuation of the 
			intellectual property of the original mod, building upon the 
			gameplay without making many significant core changes that could 
			potentially alter the overall experience. According to Valve, the 
			company contracted major contributors to DotA‍'​s popularity, in 
			order to assist in developing Dota 2, including the mod's original 
			creator known as "Eul", as well as loading screen artist Kendrick 
			Lim of Imaginary Friends Studios. In addition, the composer of 
			Warcraft III, Jason Hayes, was contracted by Valve to collaborate 
			with Tim Larkin to develop Dota 2‍'​s musical score. IceFrog stated that in order to further emphasize Dota 2's premise as a continuation of DotA, contributions would remain consistent from sources outside the main development team.</p>
			<p>To accommodate Dota 2, Valve updated the Source engine to include 
			new features, such as high-end cloth modeling and improved global 
			lighting. Dota 2 utilizes Steam to provide social and community 
			functionality for the game, while Steam users can save personal 
			files and settings using the Steam Cloud. In the tradition of 
			Valve's competitive-oriented games, Dota 2 also features multiple 
			ways to spectate live matches. The game host has the option to fill 
			open slots in matches with bots if enough human players are not 
			available. In addition to Steam-based competitive matches, Valve 
			introduced local area network (LAN) multiplayer connectivity to Dota 
			2 in September 2013. In November 2013, Valve introduced a coaching system, which allows experienced players to tutor newer players with special in-game tools.</p>
			<p>Valve added support for tournaments in June 2012. Tournaments are available for spectating in-game via the purchase of tournament tickets in the "Dota Store", which provide an alternative to viewing live streams online. The tickets allow players to watch both live and completed matches; a portion of the ticket fees go to the tournament organizers. In addition, the game's software automatically recognizes groups of players that frequently play together as teams and catalogs them as such in matches.</p>
			<p>As part of a plan to create a social network based around Dota 2, 
			Gabe Newell announced in April 2012 that the game would be 
			free-to-play, with player contributions to the community being a 
			cornerstone feature. In June 2012, the Dota development team at 
			Valve formally confirmed that the game would be free-to-play with no 
			added cost for having the full roster of Heroes and item inventory 
			readily available. Income for Dota 2 would, however, be maintained 
			through the Dota Store, where players could purchase various 
			exclusively cosmetic virtual goods, such as in-game items. Until the 
			game's release, players were able to purchase an early access 
			bundle, which included a digital copy of Dota 2, along with several 
			in-game cosmetic items. The Dota Store includes both custom 
			creations developed by Valve and a selection of user-created 
			products from the Steam Workshop that have been approved by Valve. 
			The market model was fashioned after Team Fortress 2, which had 
			reimbursed designers of cosmetic items with $3.5 million of income 
			by the time it had become free-to-play in June 2011. In January 2014, Gabe Newell revealed that the average Steam Workshop contributor to Dota 2 made approximately $15,000 from their creations in 2013.</p>
